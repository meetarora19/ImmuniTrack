# ImmuniTrack: Nationwide Digital Health & Immunization Tracker
ImmuniTrack is a comprehensive digital health tracking system designed to ensure nationwide immunization and healthcare access. The app bridges the gap between medical institutions and the public by digitizing immunization records, providing timely reminders, and optimizing vaccine supply chains. It aims to improve vaccination rates, especially in underserved areas, by leveraging technology to create a secure, user-friendly, and scalable solution.

While most institutions are going online today, we still maintain physical records for keeping track of immunization routines. They can easily be missed, spoiled or faked. 
Even though the vaccination programme is free, more than 40% of kids in India still aren’t fully vaccinated. 

This app will try to bridge the gap between medical institutions and the people by keeping track of newborns and the vaccination schedule for each of them. This will also help in maintaining the supply-demand of vaccines as they’ll be shipped accordingly.
